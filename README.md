### Abstract

We give theoretical tools, object oriented design and Java implementation for
the two dimensional steady-state heat conduction problem applying the finite element
method. NURB curves are used to describe the domain of definition. A non-uniform,
shape and size guaranteed triangulation is generated using the Delaunay refinement
algorithm. For the spatial discretization of the function space we use linear Spline basis
functions, and then we compute a set of scalars to determine the function which gives the
best approximation of the solvence on our space.
